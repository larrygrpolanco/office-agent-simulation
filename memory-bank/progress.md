# Progress Log

## Office Agent Simulation Port (as of 2025-05-23)

### What Works ✅

#### **Frontend-Backend Integration (MAJOR MILESTONE)**
- **WebSocket Architecture:**  
  - ✅ Real-time bidirectional communication established between FastAPI backend and Phaser.js frontend
  - ✅ Step-based simulation system where frontend sends environment state and backend responds with agent decisions
  - ✅ Standardized JSON protocol for communication with proper error handling
  - ✅ Automatic reconnection on connection loss
  - ✅ Debug logging for troubleshooting

- **Backend FastAPI Setup:**  
  - ✅ FastAPI server running on port 8000 with WebSocket endpoint `/ws`
  - ✅ SimulationManager class handling agent state and cognitive loop integration
  - ✅ Proper JSON response format with persona movements, pronunciatio, and metadata
  - ✅ Environment state processing and agent position tracking
  - ✅ OpenRouter API integration verified and working

- **Frontend Architecture (MAJOR REFACTOR):**
  - ✅ **Modular Component System**: Broke down monolithic 600+ line `game.js` into focused components:
    - `GameConfig.js`: Configuration, constants, and tileset definitions
    - `WebSocketManager.js`: All WebSocket communication logic
    - `AgentManager.js`: Agent creation, movement, and visual updates
    - `MapManager.js`: Map loading, tileset management, and layer creation
    - `SimulationController.js`: Step-based simulation logic, auto mode, and UI updates
    - `game.js`: Refactored main orchestrator (now ~100 lines)
  - ✅ **Improved Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
  - ✅ **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling at each layer
  - ✅ **Debug Interface**: `window.gameDebug` object for runtime debugging

#### **Simulation Features**
- ✅ **Step-Based Processing**: Manual step-by-step simulation with "Next Step" button
- ✅ **Auto Mode**: Configurable automatic stepping with adjustable delays (0.5s to 10s)
- ✅ **Reset Functionality**: Complete simulation reset with agent cleanup
- ✅ **Real-Time Updates**: Agent positions, pronunciatio (emojis), and descriptions update in real-time
- ✅ **FPS Counter**: Performance monitoring
- ✅ **Processing Time Display**: Shows how long each AI decision takes

#### **Map and Visualization**
- ✅ **Office Map Loading**: Tiled map with multiple layers (floor, walls, furniture)
- ✅ **Agent Visualization**: Dynamic agent creation and smooth movement animation
- ✅ **Camera Controls**: Arrow key navigation around the office environment
- ✅ **Speech Bubbles**: Pronunciatio system showing agent status/emojis

#### **Technical Infrastructure**
- ✅ **Maze Configuration**: Backend loads office map data from CSV files
- ✅ **Spawn System**: Agents spawn at proper locations from maze data
- ✅ **Memory Structure**: Persona memory files (spatial, scratch, associative) in place
- ✅ **API Integration**: OpenRouter API successfully tested and integrated

### What Doesn't Work / Current Issues ⚠️

#### **AI Cognitive Loop Integration**
- ❌ **Persona Initialization**: Missing `embeddings.json` file (have `embeddings.csv` instead)
  ```
  FileNotFoundError: backend/simulation/init/personas/Michael Scott/bootstrap_memory/associative_memory/embeddings.json
  ```
- ❌ **Memory File Format**: Need to convert CSV to JSON format or update AssociativeMemory class
- ❌ **Full AI Decision Making**: Currently using fallback behavior instead of actual cognitive loop

### Recent Major Achievements (2025-05-23)

1. **✅ COMPLETED: Frontend-Backend Integration**
   - Established robust WebSocket communication
   - Implemented step-based simulation architecture
   - Created standardized JSON protocol

2. **✅ COMPLETED: Frontend Code Refactoring**
   - Broke down monolithic code into modular components
   - Improved maintainability and extensibility
   - Added comprehensive error handling

3. **✅ COMPLETED: OpenRouter API Integration**
   - Verified API connectivity and response handling
   - Integrated with backend simulation manager
   - Ready for full cognitive loop integration

### Next Steps / Open Problems

#### **Immediate Priority**
1. **Fix Persona Memory Files**: Convert `embeddings.csv` to `embeddings.json` or update AssociativeMemory class
2. **Verify Persona Initialization**: Ensure Michael Scott persona loads without errors
3. **Test Full AI Cognitive Loop**: Verify end-to-end AI decision making with OpenRouter

#### **Medium-Term Goals**
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Add support for multiple office agents
- **Enhanced UI**: Agent detail panels, conversation visualization
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching and batching for multiple agents
- **Testing**: Automated tests for WebSocket communication and AI integration
