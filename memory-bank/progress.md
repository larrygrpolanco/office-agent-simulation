## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions

1. **Single-Server Architecture**:
   - **Decision**: Use FastAPI + WebSockets instead of dual-server, file-based approach
   - **Rationale**: Simplifies deployment, enables real-time communication
   - **Status**: Maintained

2. **Original Agent Architecture**:
   - **Decision**: Keep the original cognitive loop and memory systems intact initially
   - **Rationale**: Focus on getting basic simulation working before experimenting
   - **Status**: Maintained

3. **Phaser.js for Visualization**:
   - **Decision**: Use Phaser.js for frontend visualization
   - **Rationale**: Powerful 2D game engine capabilities, good for tile-based games
   - **Status**: Maintained

4. **Office Theme**:
   - **Decision**: Set simulation in an office environment like "The Office"
   - **Rationale**: Familiar context, well-defined behaviors, entertaining
   - **Status**: Maintained

5. **Hierarchical Environmental Matrix**:
   - **Decision**: Use a tree structure in all special_blocks CSVs for maximum agent context, memory, and extensibility
   - **Rationale**: Supports agent believability, navigation, and future extensibility
   - **Status**: Adopted

### Future Decision Points

1. **LLM Integration Strategy**:
   - When and how to integrate LLM API calls
   - Batching strategy for multiple agents
   - Caching and optimization approaches

2. **UI Framework Integration**:
   - When to add React for more sophisticated UI
   - How to integrate with Phaser.js canvas

3. **Agent Customization**:
   - Interface design for agent customization
   - Balance between flexibility and complexity

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Strategies for handling many agents
   - Rendering and pathfinding optimizations

## Lessons Learned

- **Hierarchical labeling in special_blocks CSVs is essential** for agent believability, memory, and extensibility.
- **Specific context is better for small maps**; use `<all>` only for generic, repeated objects in large environments.
- **Documentation-driven development** ensures the porting process can be repeated and improved for future projects.

## Next Major Focus

The next major focus is porting the core agent architecture and implementing the actual simulation logic. This includes:

1. Porting the agent cognitive loop and memory systems
2. Implementing the environment representation (maze.py)
3. Connecting the frontend and backend with real data instead of placeholders
4. Leveraging the new environmental matrix for advanced agent behaviors
