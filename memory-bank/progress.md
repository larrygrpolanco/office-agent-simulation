## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Core Port

- [x] Backend directory structure
- [x] Frontend directory structure
- [ ] Port `persona.py` and cognitive modules
- [ ] Port memory systems
- [ ] Port environment representation (`maze.py`)
- [ ] Port pathfinding (`path_finder.py`)
- [x] Create WebSocket communication skeleton
- [ ] Create basic office map
- [x] Implement placeholder map rendering in Phaser.js
- [x] Create placeholder agent visualization
- [x] Implement basic movement visualization

### Phase 2: Simulation Polish

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions

1. **Single-Server Architecture**:
   - **Decision**: Use FastAPI + WebSockets instead of dual-server, file-based approach
   - **Rationale**: Simplifies deployment, enables real-time communication
   - **Status**: Maintained

2. **Original Agent Architecture**:
   - **Decision**: Keep the original cognitive loop and memory systems intact initially
   - **Rationale**: Focus on getting basic simulation working before experimenting
   - **Status**: Maintained

3. **Phaser.js for Visualization**:
   - **Decision**: Use Phaser.js for frontend visualization
   - **Rationale**: Powerful 2D game engine capabilities, good for tile-based games
   - **Status**: Maintained

4. **Office Theme**:
   - **Decision**: Set simulation in an office environment like "The Office"
   - **Rationale**: Familiar context, well-defined behaviors, entertaining
   - **Status**: Maintained

### Future Decision Points

1. **LLM Integration Strategy**:
   - When and how to integrate LLM API calls
   - Batching strategy for multiple agents
   - Caching and optimization approaches

2. **UI Framework Integration**:
   - When to add React for more sophisticated UI
   - How to integrate with Phaser.js canvas

3. **Agent Customization**:
   - Interface design for agent customization
   - Balance between flexibility and complexity

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Strategies for handling many agents
   - Rendering and pathfinding optimizations

## Lessons Learned

*To be populated as development progresses.*

## Next Major Focus

The next major focus is porting the core agent architecture and implementing the actual simulation logic. This includes:

1. Porting the agent cognitive loop and memory systems
2. Implementing the environment representation (maze.py)
3. Creating a proper office map with Tiled Map Editor
4. Connecting the frontend and backend with real data instead of placeholders
