# Progress Log

## Office Agent Simulation Port (as of 2025-04-27)

### What Works

- **Backend FastAPI Setup:**  
  - REST endpoints for simulation state, persona thoughts, and schedule.
  - WebSocket endpoint (`/ws`) implemented using FastAPI, accepts connections and sends valid JSON on connect.
  - On receiving environment state from the frontend, backend responds with a valid JSON simulation update (persona movement, meta info).
- **Maze and Persona Initialization:**  
  - Maze configuration files copied from frontend assets to backend (`backend/office_map/maze` and `backend/office_map/special_blocks`).
  - Initial simulation state and persona memory created in `backend/simulation/init/`.
  - Backend loads initial persona state from these files on simulation start.
- **Frontend Robustness:**  
  - WebSocket handler in `frontend/src/game.js` updated to handle invalid JSON gracefully.
  - Frontend assets and map structure match backend expectations.

### What Doesn't Work / Known Issues

- **WebSocket JSON Protocol Mismatch:**  
  - Despite backend sending a valid JSON `{"status": "connected"}` on connect, the frontend still logs `Invalid JSON from server: connected` at `game.js:339`.
  - This suggests that at least one message (possibly from a proxy, server, or misconfiguration) is still being sent as plain text `"connected"` instead of JSON.
  - The simulation does not yet run end-to-end without frontend console errors.

### Next Steps / Open Problems

- **Investigate Source of Non-JSON "connected" Message:**  
  - Confirm that no other server, proxy, or middleware is sending a plain `"connected"` message.
  - Ensure the backend WebSocket handler is the only process handling `/ws` and that all messages are JSON.
  - Optionally, add a frontend filter to ignore `"connected"` if received as a string, but this is a workaround, not a fix.
- **Full End-to-End Test:**  
  - Once the above is resolved, verify that the frontend receives and processes simulation updates as intended.

### Summary

- The backend and frontend are structurally aligned and most of the porting work is complete.
- The system is not yet fully functional due to a persistent non-JSON message on the WebSocket, which prevents error-free simulation startup.
- Further debugging is required to resolve the protocol mismatch and achieve a working simulation loop.
