# Progress Log

## Office Agent Simulation Port (as of 2025-04-27)

### What Works

- **Backend FastAPI Setup:**  
  - REST endpoints for simulation state, persona thoughts, and schedule.
  - WebSocket endpoint (`/ws`) implemented using FastAPI, accepts connections and sends valid JSON on connect.
  - On receiving environment state from the frontend, backend responds with a valid JSON simulation update (persona movement, meta info).
- **Maze and Persona Initialization:**  
  - Maze configuration files copied from frontend assets to backend (`backend/office_map/maze` and `backend/office_map/special_blocks`).
  - Initial simulation state and persona memory created in `backend/simulation/init/`.
  - Backend loads initial persona state from these files on simulation start.
- **Frontend Robustness:**  
  - WebSocket handler in `frontend/src/game.js` updated to handle invalid JSON gracefully.
  - Frontend assets and map structure match backend expectations.
- **Frontend Controls Enhancement:**
  - Added simulation speed control dropdown (0.5x, 1.0x, 2.0x, 5.0x)
  - Implemented dynamic agent creation in the frontend when new agents are received from backend
  - Updated control buttons (Start, Pause, Reset) to send proper WebSocket commands to backend
  - Added speed change event handler to update simulation speed without restarting

### What Doesn't Work / Known Issues

- **WebSocket Connection Issues:**  
  - Frontend shows "Error: Not connected to server" when attempting to start the simulation
  - Backend and frontend are running but not establishing a proper WebSocket connection
  - The hardcoded WebSocket URL (ws://localhost:8000/ws) may need adjustment based on actual backend configuration
  - Despite backend sending a valid JSON `{"status": "connected"}` on connect, the frontend still logs `Invalid JSON from server: connected` at `game.js:339`.

### Next Steps / Open Problems

- **Fix WebSocket Connection:**
  - Verify backend is running on the expected port (8000) and path (/ws)
  - Check for any network/firewall issues preventing WebSocket connection
  - Ensure backend WebSocket handler is properly configured to accept connections
- **Investigate Source of Non-JSON "connected" Message:**  
  - Confirm that no other server, proxy, or middleware is sending a plain `"connected"` message.
  - Ensure the backend WebSocket handler is the only process handling `/ws` and that all messages are JSON.
- **Backend Integration:**
  - Once connection is established, integrate the Persona cognitive loop with the simulation state
  - Replace placeholder agent movement logic with actual agent decision-making
- **Full End-to-End Test:**  
  - Verify that the frontend receives and processes simulation updates as intended.
  - Test all control features (start, pause, reset, speed control)

### Summary

- The frontend has been enhanced with proper simulation controls and dynamic agent handling
- The backend and frontend are structurally aligned, but connection issues prevent full functionality
- Further debugging is required to resolve the WebSocket connection issues and achieve a working simulation loop
- Once connection issues are resolved, the next step is to integrate the Persona cognitive loop with the simulation state
