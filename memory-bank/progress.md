## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions

1. **Single-Server Architecture**:
   - **Decision**: Use FastAPI + WebSockets instead of dual-server, file-based approach
   - **Rationale**: Simplifies deployment, enables real-time communication
   - **Status**: Maintained

2. **Original Agent Architecture**:
   - **Decision**: Keep the original cognitive loop and memory systems intact initially
   - **Rationale**: Focus on getting basic simulation working before experimenting
   - **Status**: Maintained

3. **Phaser.js for Visualization**:
   - **Decision**: Use Phaser.js for frontend visualization
   - **Rationale**: Powerful 2D game engine capabilities, good for tile-based games
   - **Status**: Maintained

4. **Office Theme**:
   - **Decision**: Set simulation in an office environment like "The Office"
   - **Rationale**: Familiar context, well-defined behaviors, entertaining
   - **Status**: Maintained

5. **Hierarchical Environmental Matrix**:
   - **Decision**: Use a tree structure in all special_blocks CSVs for maximum agent context, memory, and extensibility
   - **Rationale**: Supports agent believability, navigation, and future extensibility
   - **Status**: Adopted

### Future Decision Points

1. **LLM Integration Strategy**:
   - When and how to integrate LLM API calls
   - Batching strategy for multiple agents
   - Caching and optimization approaches

2. **UI Framework Integration**:
   - When to add React for more sophisticated UI
   - How to integrate with Phaser.js canvas

3. **Agent Customization**:
   - Interface design for agent customization
   - Balance between flexibility and complexity

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Strategies for handling many agents
   - Rendering and pathfinding optimizations

## Lessons Learned

- **Hierarchical labeling in special_blocks CSVs is essential** for agent believability, memory, and extensibility.
- **Specific context is better for small maps**; use `<all>` only for generic, repeated objects in large environments.
- **Documentation-driven development** ensures the porting process can be repeated and improved for future projects.

## Next Major Focus

The next major focus is integrating the Persona agent cognitive loop into the FastAPI backend simulation loop. This includes:

1. Instantiating Persona agents in the backend simulation state
2. Updating process_environment to use persona.move(...) for agent actions
3. Connecting the frontend and backend with real agent-driven data
4. Leveraging the new environmental matrix for advanced agent behaviors
