# Office Agent Simulation: Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### Primary Motivations

1. **Learning & Exploration**: This project serves as a practical platform for learning about and experimenting with LLM-powered agents in a controlled, observable environment.

2. **Simulation Research**: The office setting provides a familiar context to explore how AI agents can simulate human-like behaviors, decision-making, and social interactions.

3. **Entertainment & Demonstration**: Creating a fun, shareable simulation that demonstrates the capabilities of generative agents in an accessible, relatable scenario.

### Secondary Goals

- **Technical Skill Development**: Practice implementing modern architecture patterns (FastAPI, WebSockets, Phaser.js, Electron)
- **Portfolio Development**: Create a showcase project demonstrating AI agent implementation
- **Foundation for Future Work**: Establish a codebase that can be extended for more complex simulations

## Problems This Project Solves

1. **Complexity of Agent Architectures**: Simplifies the original dual-server, file-based architecture into a more maintainable, real-time system.

2. **Accessibility of AI Research**: Makes the concepts from the "Generative Agents" research paper more accessible and practical for implementation.

3. **Development Friction**: Provides a foundation for experimenting with agent behaviors without needing to build the underlying architecture from scratch.

4. **Demonstration Challenge**: Creates a visually engaging way to demonstrate complex AI agent concepts to non-technical audiences.

## User Experience Goals

### Target Users

- **Primary**: The developer (you) as the main user during development and experimentation
- **Secondary**: Other developers or AI enthusiasts interested in agent simulations
- **Tertiary**: General audience who enjoy simulation games or are curious about AI behavior

### Core Experience

Users should be able to:

1. **Observe Believable Behavior**: Watch agents navigate the office environment with purpose, following realistic daily schedules and responding to their environment.

2. **Witness Emergent Interactions**: See unscripted interactions between agents based on their goals, personalities, and circumstances.

3. **Understand Agent Thinking**: Access information about what agents are thinking, remembering, and planning to understand their decision-making process.

4. **Experiment with Parameters**: Eventually modify agent personalities, goals, and environmental factors to see how behavior changes.

### Experience Evolution

#### Beta Phase
- Simple observation of agent behaviors in a basic office environment
- Limited interaction with the simulation
- Focus on core agent cognitive loop and movement

#### Future Phases
- Richer UI for deeper insights into agent cognition
- Agent customization and creation
- Environmental interaction (breaking things, cleaning, etc.)
- Scenario creation and modification
- Multiple maps and office layouts

## User Interaction Flow

1. **Launch Application**: User starts the Electron application
2. **Initial Setup**: (Future) User configures API keys for LLM integration
3. **Simulation Start**: Office environment loads with agents in starting positions
4. **Observation**: User watches agents navigate the environment and interact
5. **Interaction**: (Future) User can click on agents or objects to get information or influence behavior
6. **Customization**: (Future) User can modify agent parameters or create new agents

## Success Metrics

From a product perspective, the project will be successful if:

1. Agents exhibit believable, purpose-driven behavior in the office context
2. The simulation runs smoothly without technical issues
3. The system is extensible for adding new features and behaviors
4. The project provides genuine insights into agent architecture and behavior
5. The simulation is engaging enough to be worth sharing with others
