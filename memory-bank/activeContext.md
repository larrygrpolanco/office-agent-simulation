# Office Agent Simulation: Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We are currently in the **agent integration phase** of the Office Agent Simulation project. The focus is on:

1. **Integrating the ported agent architecture**: The Persona class and all cognitive modules and memory systems have been ported to the new backend. The next step is to connect these agents to the FastAPI simulation loop so that agent actions are generated by the cognitive loop, not placeholder logic.

2. **Connecting frontend and backend with real agent data**: The backend currently returns mock data for agent movement. The immediate goal is to have the backend process environment updates from the frontend, run the Persona cognitive loop for each agent, and return real agent-driven actions and status.

3. **Ensuring environment representation compatibility**: The maze.py environment is present and used by the agents, but pathfinding and advanced event handling may still need refinement.

## Recent Changes

- Completed port of Persona class and all supporting cognitive modules and memory structures
- Confirmed presence and compatibility of all required backend modules
- Analyzed and documented the gap between the current backend logic and the intended agent-driven simulation
- Maintained up-to-date Memory Bank and architectural documentation

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Integrate Persona agents into SimulationState**:
   - Instantiate Persona objects for each agent in the backend simulation state
   - Store and update their positions based on frontend environment data

2. **Update process_environment to use the cognitive loop**:
   - For each agent, call persona.move(...) to generate the next action
   - Populate the movements dictionary with real agent output

3. **Remove placeholder logic**:
   - Eliminate the current demo movement logic
   - Ensure all agent actions are generated by the cognitive loop

4. **Test and debug**:
   - Run the simulation with the frontend and verify agent-driven behavior
   - Debug any issues with memory, maze, or agent logic

### Medium-Term Tasks

- Refine agent behaviors for office-specific scenarios
- Improve pathfinding and event handling in the environment
- Enhance frontend visualization and UI

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Preserve original cognitive loop and memory system for initial integration**
- **Use WebSockets for real-time communication**
- **Maintain modular code structure for future extensibility**
- **Incremental implementation: focus on working agent-driven simulation before adding features**

## Learnings & Project Insights

- The ported agent architecture is robust and modular, making integration straightforward
- The main challenge is connecting the backend simulation loop to the Persona cognitive loop and ensuring state consistency
- Documentation-driven development continues to be effective for tracking progress and clarifying next steps

## Current Status Summary

The project is ready to move from placeholder agent logic to a fully agent-driven simulation. The next milestone is to see real agent cognition and movement in the frontend, powered by the Persona cognitive loop.
