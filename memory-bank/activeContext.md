# Office Agent Simulation: Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We are currently in the **AI cognitive loop integration phase** of the Office Agent Simulation project. The focus is on:

1. **âœ… COMPLETED: Frontend-Backend Integration**: Successfully established WebSocket communication between FastAPI backend and Phaser.js frontend with step-based simulation architecture.

2. **âœ… COMPLETED: Frontend Code Refactoring**: Broke down the monolithic 600+ line game.js file into modular components for better maintainability.

3. **ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS: AI Cognitive Loop Integration**: Working on connecting the Generative Agents persona system with OpenRouter API for actual AI-driven agent behavior.

## Recent Major Achievements

### Frontend-Backend Integration âœ…
- **WebSocket Architecture**: Implemented real-time communication using WebSocket protocol
- **Step-Based Simulation**: Created a step-by-step simulation system where frontend sends environment state and backend responds with agent decisions
- **JSON Protocol**: Established standardized JSON message format for communication:
  ```json
  // Frontend â†’ Backend
  {
    "action": "next_step",
    "step_id": 1,
    "environment": {
      "Michael Scott": { "x": 25, "y": 25 }
    }
  }
  
  // Backend â†’ Frontend
  {
    "persona": {
      "Michael Scott": {
        "movement": [26, 25],
        "pronunciatio": "ðŸ’¼",
        "description": "walking to the conference room",
        "chat": []
      }
    },
    "meta": {
      "curr_time": "May 23, 2025, 13:27:05",
      "processing_time": "2.3s"
    }
  }
  ```

### Frontend Code Refactoring âœ…
Broke down the large `frontend/src/game.js` (600+ lines) into modular components:

- **`GameConfig.js`**: Game configuration, constants, and tileset definitions
- **`WebSocketManager.js`**: All WebSocket communication logic
- **`AgentManager.js`**: Agent creation, movement, and visual updates
- **`MapManager.js`**: Map loading, tileset management, and layer creation
- **`SimulationController.js`**: Step-based simulation logic, auto mode, and UI updates
- **`game.js`**: Refactored main file that orchestrates all components (now ~100 lines)

### Technical Architecture Established âœ…
- **FastAPI Backend**: Running on port 8000 with WebSocket endpoint `/ws`
- **Phaser.js Frontend**: Modular component-based architecture
- **Real-time Communication**: Stable WebSocket connection with automatic reconnection
- **Step-based Processing**: Frontend triggers backend AI processing on demand
- **Auto Mode**: Configurable automatic stepping with adjustable delays
- **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting AI integration

## Current Challenge: AI Cognitive Loop Integration ðŸ”„

### Issue Identified
The persona initialization is failing due to missing/incorrect memory files:
```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 
'backend/simulation/init/personas/Michael Scott/bootstrap_memory/associative_memory/embeddings.json'
```

### Root Cause
- The persona system expects `embeddings.json` but we have `embeddings.csv`
- Memory file structure doesn't match the original Generative Agents format
- Need to examine the original example files to understand correct structure

### Next Steps
1. **Fix Memory File Structure**: Convert/create proper `embeddings.json` file
2. **Verify Persona Initialization**: Ensure Michael Scott persona loads correctly
3. **Test AI Cognitive Loop**: Verify OpenRouter API integration works end-to-end
4. **Debug AI Responses**: Use the comprehensive debug logging to troubleshoot any AI issues

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Modular Frontend Architecture**: The refactored code is much more maintainable and easier to extend
- **Step-Based vs Real-Time**: Step-based approach allows for better AI debugging and control
- **OpenRouter Integration**: Using OpenRouter API for AI responses instead of direct OpenAI
- **Debug-First Approach**: Extensive logging helps identify exactly where issues occur

## Learnings & Project Insights

### Frontend-Backend Integration Patterns
- **WebSocket Protocol**: Excellent for real-time bidirectional communication
- **JSON Message Format**: Standardized format makes debugging and extension easier
- **Component Separation**: Breaking large files into focused modules dramatically improves maintainability
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling at each layer prevents cascading failures

### AI Integration Challenges
- **Memory File Formats**: The Generative Agents system has specific file format requirements
- **Initialization Order**: Persona objects must be properly initialized before cognitive loop can run
- **API Integration**: OpenRouter provides a good abstraction layer for different AI models

## Current Status Summary

**âœ… MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED**: Frontend-backend integration is complete and robust!

**âœ… MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED**: Frontend code refactoring is complete with clean modular architecture!

**ðŸ”„ CURRENT FOCUS**: Fixing persona memory file structure to enable AI cognitive loop integration.

**Next Priority**: Once persona initialization is fixed, we'll have a fully functional AI-driven office simulation with real agent decision-making powered by OpenRouter API.

## Technical Debt & Future Improvements

- **Environment Configuration**: Make WebSocket URL configurable for different environments
- **Error Recovery**: Add more sophisticated error recovery for AI API failures
- **Performance Optimization**: Consider caching and batching for multiple agents
- **UI Enhancements**: Add agent detail panels and conversation visualization
- **Testing**: Add automated tests for WebSocket communication and AI integration
