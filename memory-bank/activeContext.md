# Office Agent Simulation: Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We are currently in the **frontend-backend integration phase** of the Office Agent Simulation project. The focus is on:

1. **Enhancing frontend controls and visualization**: We've updated the frontend with proper simulation controls (start, pause, reset, speed control) and implemented dynamic agent creation to visualize agents received from the backend.

2. **Resolving WebSocket connection issues**: The frontend and backend are not establishing a proper WebSocket connection, preventing the simulation from running. This is a critical issue that needs to be resolved before proceeding with agent integration.

3. **Preparing for agent integration**: Once the connection issues are resolved, we'll integrate the Persona cognitive loop with the simulation state to replace placeholder agent movement logic with actual agent decision-making.

## Recent Changes

- Enhanced frontend with simulation speed control dropdown (0.5x, 1.0x, 2.0x, 5.0x)
- Implemented dynamic agent creation in the frontend when new agents are received from backend
- Updated control buttons to send proper WebSocket commands to backend
- Added speed change event handler to update simulation speed without restarting
- Fixed WebSocket URL to use hardcoded localhost:8000 for development
- Improved error handling in the frontend

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Fix WebSocket Connection Issues**:
   - Verify backend is running on the expected port (8000) and path (/ws)
   - Check for any network/firewall issues preventing WebSocket connection
   - Ensure backend WebSocket handler is properly configured to accept connections
   - Investigate the source of non-JSON "connected" message

2. **Test End-to-End Communication**:
   - Once connection is established, verify that control commands are received by backend
   - Confirm that agent updates from backend are properly visualized in frontend

3. **Integrate Persona Cognitive Loop**:
   - Instantiate Persona objects for each agent in the backend simulation state
   - Update process_environment to use the cognitive loop
   - Remove placeholder agent movement logic

### Medium-Term Tasks

- Refine agent behaviors for office-specific scenarios
- Improve pathfinding and event handling in the environment
- Add agent detail panels and interaction UI
- Implement agent conversation visualization

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Use hardcoded WebSocket URL for development**: This simplifies testing but will need to be made configurable for production.
- **Implement dynamic agent creation**: This allows the frontend to adapt to any number of agents without hardcoding.
- **Add simulation speed control**: This provides flexibility for testing and demonstration.
- **Preserve original cognitive loop structure**: Once connection issues are resolved, we'll integrate the cognitive loop without major modifications.

## Learnings & Project Insights

- WebSocket connection between frontend and backend is more challenging than anticipated
- The frontend visualization and controls are now more robust and flexible
- Documentation-driven development continues to be effective for tracking progress and clarifying next steps

## Current Status Summary

The frontend has been enhanced with proper simulation controls and dynamic agent handling, but connection issues prevent full functionality. Once these issues are resolved, we can proceed with integrating the Persona cognitive loop with the simulation state.
