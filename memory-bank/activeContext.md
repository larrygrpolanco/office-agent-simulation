# Office Agent Simulation: Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We are currently in the **frontend-backend integration phase** of the Office Agent Simulation project. The focus is on:

1. **Enhancing frontend controls and visualization**: We've updated the frontend with proper simulation controls (start, pause, reset, speed control) and implemented dynamic agent creation to visualize agents received from the backend.

2. **✅ RESOLVED: WebSocket connection issues**: The frontend and backend are now successfully establishing WebSocket connections. The backend server is running on port 8000 and agents are being created and visualized properly.

3. **Preparing for agent integration**: Once the connection issues are resolved, we'll integrate the Persona cognitive loop with the simulation state to replace placeholder agent movement logic with actual agent decision-making.

## Recent Changes

- Enhanced frontend with simulation speed control dropdown (0.5x, 1.0x, 2.0x, 5.0x)
- Implemented dynamic agent creation in the frontend when new agents are received from backend
- Updated control buttons to send proper WebSocket commands to backend
- Added speed change event handler to update simulation speed without restarting
- Fixed WebSocket URL to use hardcoded localhost:8000 for development
- Improved error handling in the frontend
- **✅ FIXED: Started FastAPI backend server** - Backend now running on port 8000 with WebSocket endpoint
- **✅ FIXED: Null position handling** - Backend now provides valid spawn positions from maze data
- **✅ VERIFIED: End-to-end connection** - Frontend successfully connects, creates agents, and displays simulation

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Fix WebSocket Connection Issues**:
   - Verify backend is running on the expected port (8000) and path (/ws)
   - Check for any network/firewall issues preventing WebSocket connection
   - Ensure backend WebSocket handler is properly configured to accept connections
   - Investigate the source of non-JSON "connected" message

2. **Test End-to-End Communication**:
   - Once connection is established, verify that control commands are received by backend
   - Confirm that agent updates from backend are properly visualized in frontend

3. **Integrate Persona Cognitive Loop**:
   - Instantiate Persona objects for each agent in the backend simulation state
   - Update process_environment to use the cognitive loop
   - Remove placeholder agent movement logic

### Medium-Term Tasks

- Refine agent behaviors for office-specific scenarios
- Improve pathfinding and event handling in the environment
- Add agent detail panels and interaction UI
- Implement agent conversation visualization

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Use hardcoded WebSocket URL for development**: This simplifies testing but will need to be made configurable for production.
- **Implement dynamic agent creation**: This allows the frontend to adapt to any number of agents without hardcoding.
- **Add simulation speed control**: This provides flexibility for testing and demonstration.
- **Preserve original cognitive loop structure**: Once connection issues are resolved, we'll integrate the cognitive loop without major modifications.

## Learnings & Project Insights

- WebSocket connection between frontend and backend is more challenging than anticipated
- The frontend visualization and controls are now more robust and flexible
- Documentation-driven development continues to be effective for tracking progress and clarifying next steps

## Current Status Summary

**✅ MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED**: The WebSocket connection issues have been completely resolved! The simulation is now fully functional with:

- Backend FastAPI server running successfully on port 8000
- WebSocket connections established and stable
- "Test Persona" agent visible and responsive in the office environment
- All simulation controls (Start, Pause, Reset, Speed) working
- Real-time communication between frontend and backend
- Proper agent positioning using maze spawn locations

**Next Priority**: The foundation is now solid for integrating the full Persona cognitive loop to replace the current placeholder agent behavior with actual AI-driven decision making.
